# Respiratory System Museum

## Overview
The **Respiratory System Museum** is a 3D animation created in **Blender** for an educational college project. The animation simulates a virtual museum that educates viewers on three major deformities of the human respiratory system:

- Smoking-damaged lungs  
- Emphysema  
- Deviated nasal septum  

## Features
- A fully modeled virtual museum in Blender  
- Realistic animations of respiratory deformities  
- Character interactions  

## Scenes
1. Visitors entering the museum  
2. Tour guide welcoming the visitors  
3. Tour guide explaining the three deformations  
4. Visitors clapping in appreciation  
5. Visitors chatting  
6. A visitor filming the exhibits  
7. Detailed close-up animations of each deformation  

## Tools Used
- **Blender** – for modeling, animation, and rendering  
- **Microsoft Word** – for documentation  
- **Active Presenter** – for post-production video editing  

## How to View the Animation
1. Open the `.blend` file in **Blender**  
2. Use the **Timeline** to play the animation  
3. To render: `Render > Render Animation`  

## How to Use the Project
- **For Educators**: Demonstrate respiratory health risks  
- **For Students**: Visualize respiratory system deformations  
- **For Students**: Reference for Blender animation techniques; you can adjust lighting and texturing
